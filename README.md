In mobile application for customers, we would like to separate customers into four levels, such as: member, silver, gold, diamond. Each customer will receive different hot deals which are depended on how many moneys he spent to use service or buy products, for instance: level of customers will be member if they spent under 300€. After that if customers continue to use services and buy product until under 600€, their level will be changed to silver. Moreover, level of customers will be change to gold if they spent under 1000€, in this level customers will receive personal offers every week. Specially, in diamond level, customers will be invited to our workshop, received gifts after using services or buying products and their personal offers will be higher than other levels. To get diamond level, customers just need to spend more than 1000€. In each level, customers will receive different hot deals
